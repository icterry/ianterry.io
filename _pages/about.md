I help organizations understand their security environment and leverage industry-leading tools and methodologies. 

I've worked for a large-scale health system and a nationally recognized consulting firm, both in roles specific to cybersecurity, my professional wheelhouse and afterhours passion. From policies to vulnerability scans, I've had the opportunity to share my expertise with companies looking to cultivate and scale effective infosec and cybersec programs.

Currently, I hold a Bachelor's in Computer and Network Security from Wilmington University, a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity as recognized by the NSA and DHS. My learning didn't stop there, however, and since graduating I have attained a number of professional certifications [^1]. My curiousity spans beyond my professional realm, 

[^1]: Specifically, I hold ISC<sup>2</sup>'s SSCP and HCISPP certifications, and Certified Scrum Master (CSM).
