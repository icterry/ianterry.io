I help organizations understand their security environment and leverage industry-leading tools and methodologies, and tend to look pretty cool while doing it.

I've worked for a large-scale health system and a nationally recognized consulting firm, both in roles specific to cybersecurity, my professional wheelhouse and afterhours passion. From policies to vulnerability scans, I revel in the opportunity to share my expertise with companies looking to cultivate and scale effective security programs.

Currently, I hold a Bachelor's in Computer and Network Security from Wilmington University, a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity as recognized by the NSA and DHS. My learning didn't stop there, however, and since graduating I've attained a number of professional certifications. [^1]

My curiousity spans beyond the professional realm. I've published over 20 self-produced original songs on all major streaming platforms as an autodidactic multi-instrumentalist. I'm also an avid reader. Recently, I've begun exploring a new interest in sportshooting. Ultimately, I strive to be uncategorizable.

[^1]: Specifically, I hold ISC<sup>2</sup>'s SSCP and HCISPP certifications, and Certified Scrum Master (CSM).
